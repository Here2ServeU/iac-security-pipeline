# AI-Powered IaC Security Pipeline for T2S

This project simulates a real-world DevSecOps case for Transformed 2 Succeed (T2S), combining infrastructure, containers, secret detection, and AI-powered recommendations into one automated GitHub CI/CD workflow.

---

## Case Scenario

**Client:** T2S (Transformed 2 Succeed)  
**Problem:** Security checks were inconsistently enforced across infrastructure and app deployments‚Äîresulting in risks such as misconfigured resources, insecure containers, and secret leakage.  
**Goal:** Automate security scans and use AI to summarize findings and provide remediation strategies after every GitHub commit or pull request.

---

## Features

- Scans **Terraform** code for misconfigurations with **Checkov**
- Analyzes **Docker containers** for vulnerabilities with **Trivy**
- Detects **hardcoded secrets** with **Gitleaks**
- Uses **OpenAI** to generate a readable audit report and visual summary
- Automatically runs after every commit or PR via **GitHub Actions**

---

## Setup

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Here2ServeU/iac-security-pipeline.git
cd iac-security-pipeline
```

2. (Optional) Create a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install Python requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Add your OpenAI API key to a `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

5. Push changes or open a pull request. GitHub Actions will:
   - Run Checkov on your Terraform configs
   - Scan the Dockerfile with Trivy
   - Detect secrets using Gitleaks
   - Auto-generate:
     - `ai-security-analysis.md` ‚Äì a human-readable summary with GPT recommendations
     - `devsecops_scan_results.png` ‚Äì a visual chart of scan severity counts

---

## GitHub Actions Workflow

The workflow is defined in:

```
.github/workflows/security.yml
```

What it does:
- Runs all scanners
- Installs dependencies (Checkov, Trivy, Gitleaks, OpenAI client)
- Executes `.github/scripts/ai_analyzer.py` to analyze results and produce summary files

gitleaks-report.sarif            # Output from Gitleaks
ai-security-analysis.md          # AI-generated recommendations
devsecops_scan_results.png       # Vulnerability visual chart
requirements.txt                 # Python dependencies
```

---

## Sample Use Case Impact

This pipeline enables T2S to:
- Enforce security gates early in the CI/CD cycle
- Catch S3 misconfigs, insecure ports, or untagged resources (Checkov)
- Find outdated vulnerable libraries (Trivy)
- Block secrets like AWS keys and tokens (Gitleaks)
- Deliver a summarized, visual report via GPT to leadership and DevOps teams

---

## Tools Used

- `Checkov` ‚Äì IaC scanning
- `Trivy` ‚Äì Container scanning
- `Gitleaks` ‚Äì Secret detection
- `OpenAI` ‚Äì Remediation advice + executive summary
- `GitHub Actions` ‚Äì CI/CD pipeline automation

---

## Cleanup

```bash
deactivate
rm -rf venv
rm *.json *.sarif *.png *.md
```
